> "We all love how Vue is very easy to pick up and makes building small to medium scale applications a breeze. But today as Vue's adoption grows, many users are also using Vue to build large scale projects - ones that are iterated on and maintained over a long timeframe, by a team of multiple developers. Over the years we have witnessed some of these projects run into the limits of the programming model entailed by Vue's current API."
